## Introduction/Business Problem


Setting up shop for a new business in a new city invites a lot of challenges. One of the most important challenges a business owner or entrepreneur might face while setting up shop, is to decide on the location of the business. Depending on the choice of location, a business might thrive in a particular location, or even fail.

The most important question when opening a new outlet or setting up a new shop is whether the location is suitable for that particular business or not. Historical trends in that area, existing businesses, places or venues around that area - all are the factors which one way or another might influence the success or failure of the business. So it is important to search for patterns in this data which might provide us valueable insights.

Foursquare is a perfect candidate for providing us with such data. Foursquare is basically a location data service which crowdsources information like shops, restaurants, businesses, different places and venues etc. with respect to their geographic location and maintains a rich database. This data is easily accessible through the Foursquare API which we can utilize to solve the problem at hand.

Business owners who want to expand their business or even an entrepreneur deciding to start a business in a particuar area might benefit from this project. The aim of this project is to primarily answer the following questions which might help in their endeavor - 

* What are the hot locations for the targetted busines?
* What are the nature of existing businesses around their area?
* What would be a great location to start the business?
* If he/she has a location of choice, what is the likelihood that his business might thrive in that location?

Getting meaningful answers to these questions would go a long way in helping the stakeholder decide the location of their next successful business venture.
